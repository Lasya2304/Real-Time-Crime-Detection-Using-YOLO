# Real-Time-Crime-Detection-Using-YOLO
This project utilizes deep learning and real-time object detection with the YOLOv3 model to identify weapons (like knives) from live video feeds. The system aims to enhance personal safety by generating instant alerts, recording evidence, and allowing users to send emergency emails with their current location.
